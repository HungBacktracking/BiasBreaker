## Setup

First, you need to install the dependencies. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages for the frontend application listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server with HMR enabled. You can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a production build of the application in the `dist` directory.
